[CHROME STORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION]

Set and be reminded of expiration dates or just things expiring in general. Little one-offs you don't think about too often; like butter, medicine, or the cleaning supplies under your sink. As a developer, I spend most of my life in Chrome, which is why I decided to create this as a browser extension.

Its code is also sourced on GitHub (feel free to make a PR for adding something useful).
